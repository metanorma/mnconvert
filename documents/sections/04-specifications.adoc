== Specifications

[[sec_4.1]]
=== General, organoleptic and health characteristics

Kernels of rice, whether parboiled, husked or milled, and whether whole or broken, shall be sound, clean and free from foreign odours or odour which indicates deterioration.

The levels of additives and pesticide residues and other contaminants shall not exceed the maximum limits permitted in the country of destination.

The presence of living insects which are visible to the naked eye is not permitted. This should be determined before separating the bulk sample into test samples.

=== Physical and chemical characteristics

[[sec_4.2.1]]
==== {blank}

The mass fraction of moisture, determined in accordance with <<ISO_712>>, using an oven complying with the requirements of <<ref_9,IEC 61010-2:1998>>, shall not be greater than 15 %. footnote:[Formerly denoted as 15 % (m/m).]

The mass fraction of extraneous matter and defective kernels in husked and milled rice, whether or not parboiled, determined in accordance with <<sec_A>>, shall not be greater than the values specified in <<tab_1>>.

NOTE: Lower mass fractions of moisture are sometimes needed for certain destinations depending on the climate, duration of transport and storage. For further details, see <<ref_4,ISO 6322-1>>, <<ref_5,ISO 6322-2>> and <<ref_6,ISO 6322-3>>.

[[sec_4.2.2]]
==== {blank}

The defect tolerance for the categories considered, and determined in accordance with the method given in <<sec_A>>, shall not exceed the limits given in <<tab_1>>.
