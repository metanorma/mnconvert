         <h1 class="header">Introduction to Attributes</h1>
         <p class="para">This section describes each attribute used in the Journal Publishing Tag Set.
            Although the attributes are declared in many different modules, they are described here
            in alphabetical order of their tag names (i.e., attribute type names). The tag name is
            the shorter machine-readable name used in tagged documents, XML vocabularies, and by
            software; for example, the tag name “
            <a href="n-9xf0.html" target="main" title="Corresponding Author"><span class="attrtag">@corresp</span></a>
            ” is used for the attribute named “
            <a href="n-9xf0.html" target="main" title="@corresp"><span class="attrname">Corresponding Author</span></a>
            ”. 
         </p>
         <p class="para">Each attribute is described by a separate HTML page, where the heading for the page
            displays the attribute’s tag name followed by its longer descriptive name. The
            rest of the attribute description page discusses aspects of the attribute, its usage,
            and the elements to which it can be attached. These sections within the page always
            appear in the following order although any given attribute description may not contain
            all the sections:

                        specific elements just listed. For example, the attribute may have exactly the
                        same meaning whenever it is used, but sometimes it is required while other
                        times it is optional, so there will be two “In elements:”
                        sections, one naming all the elements for which the attribute is required, and
                        one naming all the elements for which the attribute is optional.

                        possible values of the attribute and explains selected values. When the
                        attribute originates in the Journal Publishing Tag Set or the base Suite, the
                        Values table also explains the meaning of each value. Attributes defined in
                        PUBLIC tag sets that have been incorporated into the Journal Publishing Tag Set
                        or base Suite (such as the MathML Tag Set) do not have their values explained,
                        since those values are not established in this Tag Set and may change without
                        notice.
