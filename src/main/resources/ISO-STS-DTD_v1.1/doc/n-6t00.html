         <p class="para">This section describes each element in the Tag Set. Although the elements are
            declared in many different modules, they are described here in alphabetical order of
            their tag names (i.e., element type names). The tag name is the shorter machine-readable
            name used in tagged documents, DTD fragments and schemas, and by software; for example,
            the tag name <a href="n-t2x0.html" target="main" title="Paragraph"><span class="elementtag">&lt;p&gt;</span></a> is used for the element named
            <a href="n-t2x0.html" target="main" title="<p&gt;"><span class="elementname">Paragraph</span></a>. 
         </p>
         <p class="para">Each element is described by a separate HTML page, where the heading for the page
            displays the element’s tag name followed by its longer descriptive name. The rest
            of the element description page discusses aspects of the element and its usage. These
            sections within the page always appear in the following order although any given element
            page may not contain all the sections:
